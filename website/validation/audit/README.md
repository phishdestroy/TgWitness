## Verify the original files

Run from this directory with Python and `cryptography` installed:

```sh
python VERIFY.py --key-sha256 e419743db20096763ea06e480c2e6c161341de2f1023cd339c77758fb69e212f
```

The five original files retain their signed bytes. This directory guide is
outside that signed package. The report records the state at audit time;
later changes to deployment state do not amend it.

The signature binds the published measurements to the audit key. Use the
report's revision, workload, environment and recorded check results when citing it.
The [acquisition and verification guide](../../../docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md#product-purpose-and-strengths)
describes the product's supported verification paths.
