## Install with one command

The project's official download service, `get.destroy.tools`, provides the guided
installer and its signed release files. It includes a private Python runtime and
checks package hashes and release signatures before installation. Each publication
updates the entry scripts, hashes, signatures and build information together;
each build also has an immutable release URL.

Choose the guided installer for a short setup, or use
[GitHub releases, source or Docker](QUICKSTART.md). These are supported installation
paths for the same open-source project. For a deployment that requires approval of
an exact build before execution, use [Verify before running](#verify-before-running)
with an independently retained release-key fingerprint and the build's immutable
URL. Updating the download service does not update an installed panel automatically.

**Linux / macOS (Bash):**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.destroy.tools/install.sh | bash
```

On an Ubuntu server, run as root to install a background service. On a desktop,
run as your normal user.

**Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt):**

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://get.destroy.tools/install.ps1 | iex"
```

No administrator is needed on Windows. The child PowerShell process leaves your
terminal open with the result. Python and dependencies stay in the installation.

On Ubuntu, choose **This computer**, **Temporary HTTPS link** or **Own domain**.
The installer prints the panel address and access key. For a temporary link, open
that HTTPS address in your browser and enter the key. With local access on a remote
server, use an SSH forward from your computer (`ssh -L 8787:127.0.0.1:8787 user@server`)
and open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. On macOS and Windows, the local panel opens in your
browser; keep its terminal running.

Sign in to Telegram in the panel and choose what to collect. Installation alone
does not start Telegram collection.

## Where everything runs

`get.destroy.tools` is a **Cloudflare Worker serving static downloads**. It has no
TgWitness panel, Telegram session or user evidence database. It is not routed to
a project VPS. The application runs on the machine where you execute the command.

| Installation | Program | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu as root | `/opt/tgwitness` | System service: `/var/lib/tgwitness-<installation ID>`; use `tgwitness paths` for the exact path. |
| Linux / macOS user | `~/.local/share/tgwitness` | `data/live` under that installation. |
| Windows user | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TgWitness` | `data\live` under that installation. |

Set `TGWITNESS_INSTALL_DIR` to choose another folder. Installed versions and data
are separate. The installer does not upload your accounts, messages or keys to
the download site. Choosing a Cloudflare tunnel sends panel traffic through
Cloudflare; using your own domain points to your own server.

With `TGWITNESS_TRUSTED_PROXIES`, the panel accepts a single `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` from a trusted proxy to set Secure download cookies.

Every installation includes **START-HERE.html** and **START-HERE.txt**, with local
paths, commands and links to the repository. Run `tgwitness guide` to open the guide.
On Windows, use `& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\TgWitness\bin\tgwitness.cmd" guide` in PowerShell.

## Full-text search settings

[Full-text search](SEARCH.md) (preview) needs no setup. Its index is built in the
background after an update.

| Variable or command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `TGWITNESS_FULLTEXT=disk` | Default: the index is kept in `search/fulltext.sqlite3` of each workspace |
| `TGWITNESS_FULLTEXT=memory` | No index file; the index is rebuilt at every start |
| `TGWITNESS_FULLTEXT=off` | No index; only exact-text search |
| `tgwitness index status` | Index state of every workspace |
| `tgwitness stop`, `tgwitness index rebuild`, `tgwitness start` | Rebuild every index from the signed journal |

The administrator's choice in **Journal → Filters → Search index** overrides the
variable for that workspace. Commands find the data directory of the installation
that runs them; elsewhere, add `--data-dir` with the path from `tgwitness paths`.
For a full Ukrainian dictionary (GPL-3.0 data), install `pymorphy3-dicts-uk` in the
installation's Python environment.

## Command-line access

The [command line](CLI.md) (preview) reads the archive for scripts and agents.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `TGWITNESS_URL` | Panel address for `tgwitness search`, `context`, `messages`, `stats` and `export`; default `http://127.0.0.1:8787` when a token is set |
| `TGWITNESS_MCP_TOKEN` | Archive connection token from **More tools → Integrations → MCP**, shared with MCP clients; `--token-file` reads it from a file instead |
| `TGWITNESS_DATA` | Data directory read directly when no `--data-dir`, URL or token is given |

## Verify before running

The installer embeds the project's release public key and checks SHA-256 and RSA
signatures on the application package and dependency lock before installing them.
Both Bash and PowerShell stop when a required check fails. The initial script is
delivered over HTTPS and has its own detached signature; the commands below also
let you verify that script before executing it.

The public release key is [release-signing.pub](../deploy/installer/release-signing.pub).
Its SHA-256 is:

```text
039d98a658ccda14253e45a00335b4a68d840976d8ec18b8d4355cc7c458447d
```

Retain this fingerprint from a repository revision you trust. A checksum from
the same download server detects a mismatch; the independently trusted public
key is what authenticates a release signature.

Use a new, empty directory for the verification downloads below.

**Linux / macOS — run in a new, empty download directory** (requires curl and OpenSSL):

```sh
curl -fSLO https://get.destroy.tools/install.sh &&
curl -fSLO https://get.destroy.tools/install.sh.sig &&
curl -fSLO https://get.destroy.tools/release-signing.pub &&
test "$(openssl dgst -sha256 release-signing.pub | awk '{print $NF}')" = \
  '039d98a658ccda14253e45a00335b4a68d840976d8ec18b8d4355cc7c458447d' &&
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify release-signing.pub -signature install.sh.sig install.sh &&
bash install.sh
```

The `&&` chain stops before execution if a download, key fingerprint or signature
check fails. If publication happens between downloading the script and its
signature, download both again. Old installers keep their immutable package URLs.

**Windows — inspect the SHA-256 before running:**

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://get.destroy.tools/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing
Get-FileHash .\install.ps1 -Algorithm SHA256
Invoke-RestMethod https://get.destroy.tools/SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Compare the hash with the `install.ps1` line. For an independent signature check,
use OpenSSL (for example, from Git Bash) and the same public-key fingerprint above:

```sh
curl -fSLO https://get.destroy.tools/install.ps1 &&
curl -fSLO https://get.destroy.tools/install.ps1.sig &&
curl -fSLO https://get.destroy.tools/release-signing.pub &&
test "$(openssl dgst -sha256 release-signing.pub | awk '{print $NF}')" = \
  '039d98a658ccda14253e45a00335b4a68d840976d8ec18b8d4355cc7c458447d' &&
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify release-signing.pub -signature install.ps1.sig install.ps1 &&
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

Windows installation itself verifies package signatures with .NET and does not
require OpenSSL. These are detached RSA-3072 / SHA-256 signatures, not Authenticode.
The [manifest](https://get.destroy.tools/manifest.json) records the software version,
exact Git commit, immutable release ID and each artifact's SHA-256. The page links
to the corresponding source. The manifest and checksum list also have detached
signatures (`manifest.json.sig` and `SHA256SUMS.txt.sig`).

## Update an existing installation

**A new publication updates the download site; installed programs update when you
run the installer again.** There is no unattended updater or automatic restart of a
running collection. The current installer channel is **preview**; it follows
published, checked builds from `main`, whose commit can be newer than the last
numbered GitHub release. The page's version comes from `pyproject.toml`; its commit
and build ID distinguish updates within the same preview version.

Publication is automatic after that exact commit passes the application and
security checks and the signed package is authenticated, installed and checked on
Ubuntu and Windows. Pull requests that change the installer also run `install.sh`
and `install.ps1` twice against a local copy of the site. While checks are running,
or if they fail, the same commands continue to install the previous checked build.
The build manifest shows which commit is currently available; the version number
alone may stay the same between preview updates.

Use the same installation folder and OS user as before. Back up the complete data
directory with collection stopped; `tgwitness paths` identifies it. A signed export
is not a complete installation backup.

**Ubuntu root installation at `/opt/tgwitness`:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.destroy.tools/install.sh | TGWITNESS_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/tgwitness bash -s -- --no-start
```

After a successful installation:

```sh
/opt/tgwitness/bin/tgwitness restart
/opt/tgwitness/bin/tgwitness status
/opt/tgwitness/bin/tgwitness open
```

For a Linux/macOS user installation, use its original `TGWITNESS_INSTALL_DIR` or
the default and run the first installation command again. Close a foreground
panel before updating and start it again afterwards. For a configured Linux user
service, run its `tgwitness restart` command.

**Windows:** close the running panel, run the Windows installation command again,
then open `bin\tgwitness.cmd` in the same installation. The installer retains data,
sessions, access settings and signing keys. It switches the launcher only after
the new environment passes its checks; failed installation leaves the previous
launcher in place. Keep the pre-upgrade backup for storage-format changes.

## Everyday commands on Ubuntu

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `tgwitness open` | Current panel URL and access key. |
| `tgwitness paths` | Exact program, data and guide paths. |
| `tgwitness guide --print` | Offline operating instructions. |
| `tgwitness status` / `tgwitness logs` | Availability / service logs. |
| `tgwitness stop` / `tgwitness start` | Stop / resume the service; retain data. |

## Remove TgWitness

There is no uninstaller: you stop the panel and delete its folders. Deleting the data
folder destroys journals, signing keys, Telegram sessions and saved files for good.
Before that:

1. Export what you need (**Exports → Download signed ZIP**) and keep the signing key
   fingerprint and checkpoints outside this machine. To keep the workspace itself, copy
   the whole data folder with collection stopped.
2. Delete servers created under **More tools → Extras → Server 24/7** from **Your servers** or with
   `python -m tgwitness.cloud destroy`; the provider bills them until they are deleted.
3. End each account's session in Telegram under **Settings → Devices**. Deleting the
   files does not sign the session out on Telegram's side.

**Ubuntu root installation.** Note the data folder, stop the service, then remove the
service, the folders and the shortcut:

```sh
/opt/tgwitness/bin/tgwitness paths
/opt/tgwitness/bin/tgwitness stop
systemctl list-unit-files 'tgwitness-*'
systemctl disable tgwitness-<ID>
rm /etc/systemd/system/tgwitness-<ID>.service
systemctl daemon-reload
rm -rf /opt/tgwitness /var/lib/tgwitness-<ID> /usr/local/bin/tgwitness
```

**Linux or macOS user installation.** Close the panel. A configured Linux user service
is stopped with `systemctl --user disable --now tgwitness-<ID>`; its unit is in
`~/.config/systemd/user/`. Then delete `~/.local/share/tgwitness` (or your
`TGWITNESS_INSTALL_DIR`) and the `~/.local/bin/tgwitness` shortcut.

**Windows.** Close the panel and delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TgWitness` (or your
`TGWITNESS_INSTALL_DIR`). The installer adds no service, scheduled task or shortcut.
