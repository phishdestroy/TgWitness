# Connection, proxies and data protection

Canonical page: https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/docs/reference/connection/

Authentication, automatic proxy pools, IP modes, fallback policy, external requests and secret storage.

This document describes TgWitness 0.7.0 behavior and its limits. Authentication, source access, network connectivity and capture completeness are separate states. For sign-in steps, file formats, and multiple accounts, start with [accounts and session formats](https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/docs/reference/accounts/). For event policies and restart behavior, see [how collection works](https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/docs/reference/collection/).

## Authentication methods

**API ID and API hash identify an application; they do not replace account login.** They are optional in TgWitness. Precedence: a pair entered in the form, then one from an imported account JSON, then the pair saved in the workspace, then the built-in pool of 50 public pairs, tried in random order with automatic rotation when Telegram refuses one. Only the Telegram Desktop pair (2040) is sent with a matching Telegram Desktop client description. Your own pair from API Development Tools at [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) can be used with all of your accounts; each account still has its own authorization.

| Method | Requirements | TgWitness support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phone, code, optional 2FA | Account access; API pair optional | Panel login |
| Auth Key HEX + DC ID | Full 512-character key and DC 1–5 | Direct **Auth key** tab; optional User ID checked before authorization is saved |
| Telethon StringSession | A valid session string | Panel login |
| Telethon SQLite `.session` | Closed, consistent copy | Direct panel import of schemas 7/8; optional offline CLI |
| Pyrogram SQLite `.session` | Closed production user session | Direct panel import of schemas 2/3 |
| Telegram Desktop TData ZIP | One modern account; local passcode if protected | In-memory conversion with checksum/decryption checks |
| Account JSON | Supported API/session/key fields | Metadata alone fills API credentials; a session/key or phone/QR login is still needed |
| QR login | Confirmation from an authorized Telegram app | Local QR generation, expiry/retry, optional 2FA |
| TDLib / Pyrogram StringSession | Other library-specific formats | Unsupported |
| Bot token | A bot with its own access/update model | Not used by this collector |

Telegram chooses code delivery; SMS is not guaranteed. An API hash cannot repair a revoked session or replace a forgotten 2FA password. TgWitness does not persist login codes or the Telegram 2FA password to disk.

For a private source, the account must already have access. A group username is unnecessary. A proxy or session import grants neither membership nor administrator rights. Current membership does not guarantee access to pre-join history.

## Import a Telethon session file

Telethon SQLite, Pyrogram SQLite, and Telegram Desktop TData use different formats. The panel detects and converts the supported structures; renaming a file is not conversion. Select one session and its companion JSON under **Files**, then press **Connect account**. Up to four matching files and 8 MiB total are accepted. See [format limits](https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/docs/reference/accounts/) for TData/JSON details. There is no passcode recovery. Phone/2FA or QR login creates a separate authorization.

The optional Telethon-only command-line path remains available:

1. Stop the client using the original session and make a consistent copy. The converter rejects files with an unfinished WAL/journal. Close the original client properly instead of deleting those files to bypass the check.
2. From the TgWitness environment, run:

```
python -m tgwitness.sessions account.session --out account.tgwitness-session
```

1. Under **Add account → Files**, load the result or paste its string, and continue.
2. Check the displayed numeric account ID, select sources and start observation.

The converter opens SQLite read-only, performs no schema upgrade or network request, and does not print the session. It checks schema version, table types, a single session row, IP/port/DC and key length. CLI input is limited to 64 MiB; StringSession text is limited to 4 KiB. Panel conversion uploads files to the authenticated TgWitness server, processes them in memory, and returns the normalized credentials to that browser without saving the uploaded originals. Use HTTPS for a remote server.

**The converted file is an unencrypted account-access secret.** Keep it in protected storage and never commit it or send it to a third-party conversion service. TgWitness saves the authorized session in its encrypted vault. Copying a session does not create a separate authorization: do not run concurrent clients with cloned auth keys and assume independent update delivery.

Conversion transfers authorization, not original messages, the entity cache or a durable update cursor. It does not fix update recovery across process restarts.

## MTProto, Telethon and proxies

MTProto is Telegram's protocol. Telethon is the Python client library TgWitness uses. MTProxy is a Telegram transport proxy; SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT provide general tunnels. None replaces account authentication.

Save the route for each workspace in **Account → Settings → Connection settings → Change connection route** before signing in. New workspaces default to **Automatic MTProxy · public lists** with Hide IP behavior. Existing workspaces that explicitly used Direct retain a mode permitting it.

## IP modes

The route chooses the connection. The IP mode determines when the server's address may be exposed. These controls do not install a VPN or route all machine traffic.

| Mode | Telegram | External requests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hide IP (`hide`) | Use a proxy; wait if none works. No direct fallback. | Require SOCKS5/HTTP; refuse requests without an applicable proxy. |
| Allow fallback (`fallback`) | Automatic MTProxy may use Direct after the configured delay, then return to a working proxy. | Prefer a configured external proxy or the account's SOCKS5/HTTP route; otherwise Direct is allowed. |
| Tunnel / VPN (`tunnel`) | Direct routes and immediate automatic-pool fallback are permitted. | Direct is permitted when no applicable proxy is configured. |

Tunnel/VPN mode assumes you manage that network separately. Without a working tunnel, destinations can see the server's own address. Select the mode according to your actual network, not the name of the option.

### Choose a route

| Route | Settings | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automatic MTProxy | Built-in lists or an operator catalog | Maintains a working Telegram route; direct fallback depends on the IP mode |
| Direct | Tunnel/VPN mode | Telethon uses the host's network route |
| SOCKS5 | Host, port, optional username/password | python-socks, remote destination DNS enabled |
| HTTP CONNECT | Host, port, optional username/password | Plain HTTP CONNECT; TLS to the proxy itself is not implemented |
| MTProxy | Host, port, secret | Experimental Telethon transport; 32 hex digits or `dd` + 32 hex digits |

Fake TLS `ee` secrets are rejected. Telethon 1.45's normalization can strip a prefix and domain, but that does not implement Fake TLS. Paste `tg://proxy?server=…&port=…&secret=…` or `https://t.me/proxy?server=…&port=…&secret=…` and choose **Fill fields from link**. This validates and fills the fields without connecting or saving; review and save the route separately. Manual fields remain available. See [Telegram proxy links](https://core.telegram.org/api/links#proxy-links).

### Public proxies supplied by your installation

The built-in list combines four sources: [SoliSpirit/mtproto](https://github.com/SoliSpirit/mtproto), [zakky8/mtproto-proxy-pro](https://github.com/zakky8/mtproto-proxy-pro), [kort0881/telegram-proxy-collector](https://github.com/kort0881/telegram-proxy-collector) and [3yed-61/MTP-Collector](https://github.com/3yed-61/MTP-Collector). The bundled snapshot contains endpoint facts, source attribution and download dates. A provider's listing is not proof that the proxy works or delivers every Telegram update.

**Automatic MTProxy** checks Telegram transport connectivity, keeps a working proxy and switches to another when it fails. Workspaces prefer different proxies when enough working entries are available; a unique exit address is not guaranteed. Failed proxies rest before another attempt. If none works, the IP mode determines whether collection must wait or may use a direct connection. Changing proxies does not change the account or erase its journal. Route choices and changes are recorded in the signed journal.

While automatic routes are active, lists refresh hourly and transport checks run every ten minutes by default. These intervals are configurable. **Update public lists** requests a refresh; viewing the list alone does not change a saved manual route.

Each feed response is limited to 1 MiB with an eight-second request timeout and a 20-second overall download deadline; redirects are rejected. Up to 64 compatible entries per source are retained and deduplicated. The parser accepts supported hexadecimal and base64url secrets and the JSON feed. Fake TLS `ee`, invalid links, private/reserved IP literals and local hostnames are skipped. Hostnames are resolved and checked before use, and the chosen IP is pinned for that connection. Automatic reacquisition resolves a hostname again; reapply a manual entry to resolve it again.

Failed, empty or incompatible feed responses retain the previous source snapshot. Updates are atomic, serialized and limited to one attempt per minute per workspace. A successful transport probe establishes connectivity, not anonymity or capture completeness.

**Telegram traffic and HTTPS requests use different routes.** List downloads use a separate HTTPS connection and the supplied external-request route. `TGWITNESS_PROXY_FEED_PROXY` explicitly overrides that route with an HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy; both collector Compose variants forward it. The background pool follows the main workspace. No Telegram session, API credentials, panel token or bot token is sent to feed providers. Provider names, snapshot dates and the download route appear under **Where the list comes from**.

An MTProxy carries Telegram traffic only. Workspace HTTP operations such as timestamps, notifications, off-site copies and source checks use a separate SOCKS5/HTTP proxy when configured, then the account's SOCKS5/HTTP route. Without either, Hide IP refuses the request; the other modes permit Direct. External requests can be disabled. An explicitly configured feed-download proxy remains a separate operator override. The independent witness service keeps its own route.

****Automatic pool parameters**** Under **Parameters → Automatic MTProxy**, configure the failure threshold, cooldown, planned rotation, proxy sharing and permitted fallback delay. | Control | Default | | --- | --- | | Disconnects before replacement | 3 within 10 minutes | | Proxies tried per connection attempt | 3 | | First / maximum rest after failure | 10 minutes / 6 hours | | Planned rotation | Disabled; switch on failure | | Accounts per proxy | 0: prefer separate entries, share when needed. Set 1 to wait for an exclusive entry. | | Delay before permitted Direct fallback | 10 minutes; Hide IP still refuses Direct | | Feed refresh / transport checks | 60 / 10 minutes; main workspace values apply to the shared pool | Different proxies do not guarantee different exit addresses. These settings do not override Telegram limits or prove anonymity.

To replace the public list with your own operator catalog, configure the override below. It disables external subscriptions entirely, including when its `proxies` array is empty.

Copy [the empty catalog](https://github.com/phishdestroy/TgWitness/blob/main/deploy/proxies.config.example) to `proxy-config/proxies.json` and add your deployed public endpoints:

```
{"format": "tgwitness-proxy-catalog-v1", "proxies": [
  {"id": "project-eu", "label": "Project EU",
   "link": "tg://proxy?server=REPLACE_HOST&port=443&secret=REPLACE_SECRET"}
]}
```

The example values must be replaced. Up to 32 distinct entries are accepted. The authenticated listing returns labels/hosts/ports without shared secrets; selecting one saves its credentials into the workspace vault. Availability remains untested until an explicit transport test. A malformed catalog leaves manual configuration available.

Native launch: set `TGWITNESS_PROXY_CATALOG` to the local JSON path. Docker:

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f deploy/compose/compose.proxies.yaml up -d --build
```

The overlay mounts `proxy-config` read-only; files must be readable by container UID 10001. That directory is excluded from Git, Docker build context and source archives. This catalog configures the collecting accounts; [the witness bot](https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/docs/reference/witness/) uses its own HTTP/SOCKS5 route, not MTProxy.

Direct fallback is governed by the IP mode above. Pause observation before changing a route. Saving disconnects old clients and cancels unfinished login; a new client uses the saved route. The account's journal/session binding remains. Settings replace the previous route: re-enter proxy credentials when editing it.

Credentials are encrypted in `network.enc`. The API does not return the username, password or secret. Signed records contain the route type and whether credentials are present, excluding the endpoint and secrets. The operator can see the endpoint in the panel. Secret fields clear after saving, locking or switching workspaces.

**Test Telegram connection**, also available before login, opens and closes a temporary unauthorized Telegram connection through the route. It does not contact an IP-check website. Success establishes transport connectivity, not group access, complete delivery or anonymity.

The proxy applies to the Telegram client's connections, including Telegram DC media downloads. Browser, pip, SSH and manually invoked TSA tools have separate routes. The proxy hostname may be resolved locally. `rdns` affects destination hostnames; Telegram often supplies numeric DC IPs.

SOCKS5 and plain HTTP CONNECT do not themselves encrypt proxy credentials or the client-to-proxy tunnel. MTProto separately protects Telegram traffic. Use an appropriate secure channel to the proxy on an untrusted network. Private groups are cloud chats; MTProto does not turn them into end-to-end encrypted Secret Chats.

## Encryption and signatures

| Layer | Implemented | Operator responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram traffic | Telethon MTProto | Platform trust, route and availability |
| Web panel | Bearer token, loopback default, request limits | HTTPS or SSH tunnel for remote access |
| Secrets | Fernet for API credentials, session, proxy credentials and signing private key | Protect the decryption key and running host |
| Vault key | Local key, or external master key for a new installation | Separate protected storage and key backup |
| Messages and attachments | Plaintext application storage | Encrypted disk/volume |
| ZIP/JSONL/CSV/HTML | Integrity checks, no content encryption | Protect exported copies and transfers |
| Provenance and time | Signed journal, process receipt, RFC 3161 tools | Trusted key, independent checkpoints/TSA and custody procedure |

**Storage protection** in Account shows these states. The panel token is an access secret, not an encryption password. It grants administrator access; [issued tokens](https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/docs/reference/access/) can be scoped to accounts and chats. Workspaces share the host process and are not isolated tenants.

An explicitly started, isolated synthetic demo can open automatically over a direct loopback connection. This uses a separate process-lifetime capability; it neither reveals the configured panel token nor grants access to real workspaces. Remote, proxied or cross-origin requests cannot obtain/use this automatic-entry capability. This convenience does not remove the authentication boundary for real account data.

BitLocker, LUKS, FileVault or a managed encrypted volume can protect storage under their respective threat models. An administrator of an unlocked running machine can still read data. Include SQLite WAL/SHM, media, temporary exports, swap, backups and browser downloads in storage planning. A Docker volume is not encrypted merely because it is a volume. TgWitness does not implement SQLCipher or object encryption.

## External master key

For a **new** installation, place the master key outside the data directory. This does not automatically migrate an existing local-key vault. Prepare a key directory accessible only to the service identity, then run:

```
python -m tgwitness.security create-master-key /private/keys/tgwitness-master.key
export TGWITNESS_VAULT_KEY_FILE=/private/keys/tgwitness-master.key
python -m tgwitness --data-dir /private/observations/new-case
```

PowerShell, using the installed project environment:

```
python -m tgwitness.security create-master-key E:\PrivateKeys\tgwitness-master.key
$env:TGWITNESS_VAULT_KEY_FILE = 'E:\PrivateKeys\tgwitness-master.key'
python -m tgwitness --data-dir E:\PrivateData\new-case
```

In Docker, mount the file read-only outside `/data`, for example at `/run/secrets/tgwitness-master.key`, and set the environment variable to that path. The service UID must be able to read it. Pass the path, not the key bytes, through environment/configuration files.

Each workspace receives a random public salt and its own Fernet key derived through HKDF-SHA256. `vault.external.json` stores derivation metadata, not the master key. A missing/wrong key fails startup without silently replacing it. Retain both the salt metadata and master key for recovery.

All workspaces derive from the same master key; its compromise affects the entire installation. The running process can decrypt secrets. This is not an HSM or password KDF. Arbitrary human passwords are not accepted in place of a random key.

Keep the existing key for existing installations until a deliberate migration is implemented and verified. Deleting `vault.key` or replacing a master key can destroy access to sessions/signing keys. Keep encrypted backups and keys separately and test recovery in an isolated instance.
