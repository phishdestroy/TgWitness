**Status checked on 6 November 2026:** a separate Secret Chat implementation exists in development. It has not been merged into published `main` at `3d23e52b647b`. The ordinary collector and Takeout export do not collect Secret Chats. The interactive website scenario demonstrates the interface with fictional data; it does not enable Telegram communication.

## Where the implementation lives

Commit `0e60f88e` added **Sources → Pseudo-secret** in the local development branch `fix/panel-routes-sessions`. The checked snapshot is `bb8788fb685c`. Its implementation includes `tgwitness/secret_chats.py`, application routes, `tgwitness/static/views/secret-chats.js` and dedicated tests.

The optional `secret-chats` extra in that branch uses [KiaroSama/Telethon-Secret-Chat](https://github.com/KiaroSama/Telethon-Secret-Chat), pinned to `d87bf037b90060383c7b704d8a06ebb98c621c6f`. The library implements Telegram's end-to-end chat protocol on the account's existing Telethon authorization. Installing that library alone does not add the missing integration to `main`.

## What the development interface does

| Acción | Recorded behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Start a chat by username or user ID | Send a request; the other participant must accept it. |
| Accept an incoming request | TgWitness becomes the receiving endpoint for that chat. Automatic acceptance is a separate setting, off by default. |
| Send or receive a message | Add an outgoing or incoming `secret_chat.message` record and show it in the thread. |
| Receive an attachment | Decrypt it, store its bytes by SHA-256 and record `secret_chat.file`. |
| Receive a timer or deletion notice | Record the notice and retain previously captured content. |
| Review the conversation | Show messages, files, notices and the key visualization. The open tab refreshes every four seconds. |

In a development build containing the integration, the operator enables the module for the selected account and connects it. Starting, accepting and sending require permission to interact and the account's read-only protection to be off. The other participant must accept a new outgoing chat. These controls are not present in the published application at the revision above.

Only chats created or accepted by this TgWitness session are covered. Existing Secret Chats on a phone remain on that device. A session import does not supply their separate encryption keys. Secret-chat key material and counters are stored in the workspace vault; preserved messages and decrypted files follow the normal workspace storage protections.

## Website demonstration

The website's **Try Secret Chat** scenario opens a fictional conversation. It lets the reader start a request, simulate its acceptance, send a sample message, receive a scripted reply and file, and inspect a timer and deletion notice. An incoming request can also be accepted. The controls label simulated peer actions explicitly.

This scenario runs in browser memory. Reset or reload clears it. It does not log in, contact Telegram, create real encryption keys or alter the signed sample downloads. Its displayed messages are not signed evidence. The scenario demonstrates intended interaction; it does not certify that the development implementation is ready.

## Checks and outstanding defects

The five existing tests cover encrypted key persistence, lifecycle and message records, incoming acceptance policy, read-only sending and attachment export. They passed against the pinned library during the 6 November review. Three additional synthetic checks reproduced defects in the same snapshot:

| Finding | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Closing bypasses `read_only` | The close path can perform a remote action when interactions should be blocked. |
| Duplicate detection searches only 500 recent records | An older replay can create a duplicate after restart. |
| A failed attachment download removes its pending entry | A transient failure loses the retry job. |

These are open defects, also recorded in the [published audit](https://github.com/phishdestroy/TgWitness/blob/main/website/validation/audit/REPORT.md). Five passing tests do not cover these failures. The review used synthetic workspaces and mocked Telegram operations; it did not repeat a live handshake or qualify production deployment.
