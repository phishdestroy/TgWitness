# Security and data handling

TgWitness runs on your own computer or server. By default the only connection that leaves
it is the account's connection to Telegram; notifications, timestamps, an off-site copy and
a witness are separate switches. This page lists what is protected, how, and what is left
to the operator.

| Area | In short |
| --- | --- |
| Access | One panel token controls every workspace; the panel listens on 127.0.0.1 by default |
| Secrets at rest | Session, API pair, signing key and proxy settings are encrypted with Fernet |
| Messages and media | Stored unencrypted: use disk encryption and strict permissions |
| Integrity | SHA-256 hash chain and an Ed25519 signature on every record |
| Not covered | A machine administrator, a leaked panel token, completeness of capture |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use **Security → Report a vulnerability** in this project's GitHub repository
when private vulnerability reporting is enabled. Include the affected version,
impact and a minimal synthetic reproduction. Do not send credentials, account
directories or real evidence archives.

If the private reporting option is unavailable, open a public issue asking for a
private reporting channel, without disclosing exploit details or sensitive data.
Security fixes target the latest version, currently 0.6.1. Older
versions are not maintained separately. There is no independent security
certification or guaranteed response time.

## Access model

TgWitness is a single-operator collector. Anyone holding the panel token can read and
export the journal, change collection scope, and authorize a Telegram account.
There are no roles, per-user permissions, or tenant isolation. Workspaces isolate
sessions and evidence storage, but the same panel token controls every workspace.

The panel listens on localhost by default. Data and control API endpoints require
a bearer token. No authentication cookie is used. The token is kept in the browser's
sessionStorage and removed by Lock workspace. A closed browser or locked panel does
not pause the collector. Use Pause observation to stop it.

Failed token requests are limited per client address. Valid panel and witness tokens
remain usable when another client at the same proxy address reaches that limit. The
panel token and witness tokens still grant separate capabilities.

### Demo access

`/api/demo-access` is a deliberately unauthenticated bootstrap for an explicitly
started, isolated synthetic demo. It issues a separate process-lifetime capability,
never the real panel token or a TGWITNESS_TOKEN override. Issuance and use require a
loopback peer and Host, no forwarded headers, and no cross-origin request. Additional
workspaces or an authorized session disable this path. Live workspaces never issue
the capability. The demo cannot connect accounts or change collection settings.

## Panel content and exports

The panel uses no external fonts, analytics, CDN resources, or embedded remote media.
Telegram-sourced text is inserted as text, not HTML. Downloaded attachments are
served as binary attachments. JSONL exports preserve original strings; HTML escapes
them; CSV cells that could become formulas are prefixed with an apostrophe.

Exports exclude authentication and signing secrets, but deliberately contain
collected source metadata, identifiers, and possibly personal or sensitive content.
Telegram access hashes and file references can occur in raw source metadata.

## Secrets at rest

Telegram API credentials, StringSession, and the Ed25519 private key are encrypted
using Fernet. By default its key is stored in the same protected data directory.
This reduces accidental plaintext exposure; it is not protection against an attacker
who can read the whole directory. Message content and media are **not encrypted**
by TgWitness. Use disk encryption and restrictive OS permissions. Unix private key
files are created with mode 0600; newly created data directories use mode 0700.
Existing directory permissions are not changed. Windows inherits directory ACLs: restrict them
to the service account and authorized administrators.

### External master key

For a new data directory, TGWITNESS_VAULT_KEY_FILE can supply an external random
master key. HKDF-SHA256 and a separate random salt derive a different Fernet key
for each workspace. vault.external.json must be retained for recovery. Missing or
wrong master keys fail closed. Existing local vaults are not silently migrated.
The running process can access the key; this is not HSM isolation. The panel reports
the selected mode and explicitly states that message/media storage is not encrypted
by the application. See [connection, proxies and data protection](../docs/CONNECTION-SECURITY.md)
for the full threat model.

## Proxies and network routes

Proxy configuration is encrypted in network.enc. Proxy passwords, usernames and
MTProxy secrets are not returned by the API or written to evidence events. Each
workspace has its own route. No automatic direct fallback is configured. This applies
to Telegram transport, not all machine traffic or DNS resolution of the proxy host.
SOCKS and ordinary HTTP CONNECT proxy authentication are not TLS-protected by
the proxy protocol itself. Fake TLS MTProxy secrets are rejected.

## Sign-in and session imports

Converted .tgwitness-session files contain a plaintext authorization secret until
loaded and stored in the vault. The offline CLI accepts reviewed Telethon schemas.
Panel import additionally accepts Pyrogram SQLite, modern single-account TData ZIP,
and documented JSON inputs. It is authenticated, limited to four files / 8 MiB,
and processes uploads in memory without archive extraction or saving original files.
Normalized credentials are returned only to the requesting authenticated browser;
they are saved in the encrypted vault after successful Telegram authorization.
Protect originals and converted files, and avoid concurrent clients cloning an authorization.

TData processing verifies container checksums, local decryption hashes, and structure
lengths. A supplied Desktop local passcode is used transiently and is not stored.
This bounded parser does not establish that every Desktop version is compatible.
QR images are generated locally, contain short-lived Telegram login tokens, and
are never sent to an external rendering service. Lock, workspace switch, new login,
and route changes cancel pending QR attempts. Reload/closing a tab may leave an
attempt pending until expiry. A successful QR login still enforces account binding.
Ordinary API bodies remain limited to 16 KiB; the authenticated import route accepts
up to 12 MiB of encoded JSON, enforcing the smaller decoded-file limit separately.

Login codes and Telegram two-step verification passwords are not persisted. Phone number/code-hash state is
held in memory during authorization. Telegram sessions grant account access; never
upload a data directory, session, token, vault key, or private signing key to GitHub.

## Logs and transport

The default API validation response is replaced so it does not echo credential
values. Application access logging is disabled. Do not configure a reverse proxy
to log Authorization headers or request bodies. HTTP carries tokens and login
secrets in plaintext: use HTTPS or an SSH tunnel whenever leaving localhost.

## Integrity limits

The hash chain, database triggers, and signatures detect certain modifications;
they do not prevent a local administrator from rewriting and resigning the journal.
Retain signed checkpoints and the public-key fingerprint on a separate system.
Evidence mode and the off-site copy (both off by default) send checkpoint hashes to
timestamp services and encrypted copies to S3-compatible storage; see the
[evidence format](../docs/EVIDENCE.md). Transparency logs, HSM-backed signing and formal
chain-of-custody certification are not implemented.

## If you suspect a problem

Preserve the original data directory and use a separate copy for analysis. Do not
include private Telegram data or credentials in a public issue. No independent
security certification is claimed.
