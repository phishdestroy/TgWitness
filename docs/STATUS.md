[Choose a collection method](COLLECTION-MODES.md) for scope, output and recovery behavior.
[Secret Chat installation and package check](PSEUDO-SECRET.md) records the shipped
integration, optional protocol dependency and account-level controls.
[Development history and scale](OVERVIEW.md#testing-history-and-duration) puts the
public release timeline and selected measurements in context.
[Actions](https://github.com/phishdestroy/TgWitness/actions) records automated checks
for each revision; [Verification](VERIFICATION.md) records completed deployment and
live-account tests. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for changes.

The optional forensics helpers match complete MTProto frames against the journal offline:
the frame helper verifies payload digests and message identifiers against journal references.
Frames are supplied explicitly; a PCAP file travels in the bundle as an attachment.
The frame-match result is reviewed together with the acquisition path, capture records and custody.
