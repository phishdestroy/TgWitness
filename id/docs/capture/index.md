**Preview available from `main`.** A fork launches a pinned reusable workflow from `phishdestroy/TgWitness`. The workflow reads one selected chat using a newly created Telegram session, attests the resulting evidence ZIP, and uploads only recipient-encrypted handoffs. The normal administration panel is not exposed.

This is an ordinary GitHub-hosted runner, not confidential hardware. GitHub, the approved collector and dependencies, the helper page, the browser, and the HTTPS tunnel remain in the trust boundary. A GitHub attestation binds bytes to an approved workflow; it does not give the messages a Telegram signature, establish historical completeness, or certify that nobody accessed the host.

## User flow

The helper explains the five stages and lets you try message or collector substitution on sample data. **Start my capture** opens the wizard.

1. Choose **GitHub Actions capture (preview)** on the project homepage, the workspace login screen, or **Exports → Open capture helper**. You can also open the [official helper](https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/sealed.html?lang=en) or `tgwitness/static/capture.html` from a trusted checkout in a modern browser. The helper makes no network requests for key or file processing. It is available in English and Russian.
2. Generate a key and save **sealed-key.json**. This is the only private decryption key. Copy the separate public **recipient** value. Losing the private key loses access to both the connection and the archive. Confirm that you saved it to unlock the next step. If you already have a delivery file, load the saved key and choose **I already have an archive**.
3. Fork TgWitness, enable Actions in the fork, and run **Sealed chat capture**. Paste the public recipient and choose 30, 60, or 120 minutes. Never put a phone number, login code, Telegram password, private key, or session in workflow inputs, commits, issues, or logs.
4. During the run, download **sealed-connection** from Artifacts and unzip it. Load `connection.tgwsealed` in the helper, using the saved private key. The resulting link contains a random access secret in its URL fragment. Keep this link private. The panel removes the fragment and keeps the secret in this tab's session storage; it is not placed in HTTP access logs.
5. Open the connection link. Sign in with a QR code, or with your phone number and the login code. Enter your two-step verification password if Telegram asks for it. The built-in API credential pool is used by default, just like the normal workspace. You may expand the optional custom credentials section and enter both `api_id` and `api_hash` from [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps). Leave both fields empty to use the built-in pool; a partial or malformed pair is rejected. Session imports are not allowed. Load the chats and choose one source. The connection link contains an access secret: keep it private.
6. Load the dialogs and select one chat. Capture starts immediately. The selected source cannot be changed after starting. You can resume a paused history read, finish with the data already collected, or cancel without producing an archive. History reading and attachment downloading finish separately. Deadline expiry after starting produces an explicitly partial archive; expiry before starting produces no archive.
7. Wait for **sealed-result**, download and unzip it, and decrypt `delivery.tgwsealed` in the helper. You receive `delivery.zip`, containing `evidence.zip`, `attestation.jsonl`, and instructions. Browser decryption is limited to 256 MiB; larger packages use the streaming local command below.
8. End the temporary session in Telegram Settings → Devices if revocation was not confirmed or the runner was killed. Normal completion attempts logout; network failures and forced runner termination prevent an absolute guarantee.

The repository must contain the published pinned source and reusable-workflow commits. A local branch alone cannot be invoked by another GitHub repository.

## Choose this mode or a persistent workspace

| Need | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| Collect one accessible chat during a limited session and give a reviewer an externally attested archive | GitHub Actions capture (preview) |
| Observe several chats continuously, manage accounts, search and read a growing archive | Local or Docker workspace |
| Prove that messages were never fabricated, recover unseen deletions, or hide live processing from the hosting provider | Neither mode establishes this |

This starts a separate capture with a new login. It does not upload your existing local journal, export the currently open workspace, or reuse its Telegram session. An unfinished cloud capture cannot resume after its runner is destroyed; a new workflow starts a new capture. The helper is English/Russian; its entry points are translated with the rest of the interface.

The workspace's **Exports → Open capture helper** opens the complete wizard inside the panel. The standalone page uses the same wizard, controls and themes. Both keep keys and decryption in your browser. GitHub workflow startup and the temporary Telegram panel open in separate tabs; the wizard tells you when to return. Locking the workspace clears the wizard's in-memory key. Your saved key file remains on your device.

## What is public, and what must stay private

Forking copies project code into your repository. It does **not** export your Telegram account. The recipient workflow input is a public encryption key. Keep `sealed-key.json`, Telegram credentials, login codes, 2FA passwords and the decrypted connection URL out of commits, workflow inputs and public logs.

The workflow publishes encrypted connection/result artifacts for one day. Download both in time; GitHub Actions availability, account limits and billing apply. A public fork is not a promise of unlimited free compute. No payment or GitHub access token is entered into the helper.

The private decryption key stays in your browser/file. Telegram session material and plaintext observations necessarily exist inside the temporary collector. GitHub and the HTTPS tunnel remain trusted infrastructure. Attestation may make the archive digest and workflow identity public; the archive contents are not placed in the attestation. The attestation timestamp is not a message timestamp.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Next step |
| --- | --- |
| No **Run workflow** button | Open your own fork, enable Actions, and sync it with upstream `main`. Do not edit the approved upstream pins to bypass a failure. |
| No `sealed-connection` artifact | Check whether the job started and completed its startup/upload step. Queue, runner, image download, tunnel or repository policy failures can prevent startup. |
| Cannot open the connection | Load the saved key for this run, unzip the downloaded artifact and select `connection.tgwsealed`. The runner must still be active. |
| History is paused | Check the panel's status and use Resume while the session remains active, or finish with the data already collected. Telegram limits and inaccessible content can leave gaps. |
| No `sealed-result` | Cancellation or expiry before selecting a chat produces no archive. A failed collection, attestation or packaging step also prevents delivery. Inspect the failed step without posting credentials. |
| Browser cannot decrypt a large archive | Use the streaming CLI below for packages larger than 256 MiB. A wrong or lost private key cannot decrypt the result. |
| Verification rejects the signer | Use a trusted current TgWitness installation and the exact caller `OWNER/REPOSITORY`. Do not accept a replacement policy supplied with the archive. |
| Telegram still lists the temporary session | End it in Settings → Devices. Logout can fail and a forcibly terminated workflow may not run cleanup. |

Before relying on this preview, try a small chat you control: create a message and attachment, collect them, decrypt the result, run the verifier, check the coverage/media outcomes and confirm Telegram session revocation. Automated checks use a synthetic Telegram client plus a separate real GitHub certificate test; they do not establish live account acceptance.

## Local decryption and verification

Use tools from an independently trusted installation, not executable files supplied by an unknown evidence archive:

```
python -m tgwitness.sealed_crypto decrypt delivery.tgwsealed --key sealed-key.json --out delivery.zip
# Unzip delivery.zip using your archive manager, then:
python -m tgwitness.sealed_verify evidence.zip --bundle attestation.jsonl --repo OWNER/TgWitness
```

Python 3.11+, the project's dependencies, and a recent GitHub CLI supporting `--signer-digest` and `--deny-self-hosted-runners` are required. A CLI key generator is also available: `python -m tgwitness.sealed_crypto keygen sealed-key.json`.

The verifier uses `tgwitness/sealed_policy.json` from the trusted installation. It checks the caller repository, upstream signer workflow, approved signer commit, hosted runner requirement, complete ZIP digest, internal journal and attachment integrity, fresh account-key origin, and expected collector commit. It displays history and media outcomes instead of implying all data was saved. An empty approved-release list fails closed. Updating the policy is an explicit trust decision; never accept an archive's own proposed policy automatically.

For offline use, obtain trusted roots ahead of time from a trusted environment:

```
gh attestation trusted-root > trusted_root.jsonl
python -m tgwitness.sealed_verify evidence.zip --bundle attestation.jsonl --repo OWNER/TgWitness --trusted-root trusted_root.jsonl
```

The timestamp of the attestation concerns the archive's commitment. It does not authenticate message timestamps or the collector's wall clock. See [GitHub's verification options](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation_verify).

## How the fork is kept outside the capture process

The caller contains a job-level reference to the upstream reusable workflow at a full commit SHA. That workflow explicitly checks out **the upstream repository at a fixed collector SHA**. A default `actions/checkout` in a reusable workflow would check out the caller and is intentionally not used.

The workflow does not restore caller caches, consume caller artifacts, execute caller files, or accept source/image URLs, shell commands, prepared ZIP files, or hashes to sign. It accepts a bounded public recipient and session duration. Actions, the Python base image, and cloudflared are pinned by immutable digests; Python dependencies use the existing hash-locked requirements. The image is built from the trusted source without a cache.

The collector runs as a non-root user with a read-only image, dropped Linux capabilities, resource limits, and no Docker socket or GitHub-token environment. Its only mounts are fresh configuration, workspace, and output directories. The restricted FastAPI application exposes login, dialogs, one-chat collection, status, resume, finish, and cancellation. There is no plaintext download route, general administration route, import route, or signing endpoint.

The supervisor stops the network-facing containers before the attest action reads the final fixed `evidence.zip`. The packaging container has no network. The upload steps name only `connection.tgwsealed` and `delivery.tgwsealed`; neither plaintext evidence nor Telegram credentials are uploaded as artifacts. Cleanup removes the private directories and containers, with no claim of physical disk erasure. Artifact retention is one day; download before expiry.

A fork owner can replace the caller or create a different signed file. The strict verifier must reject the resulting **different signer workflow/digest**. This construction still depends on the absence of exploitable bugs in approved code and on the integrity of GitHub's runner and signing infrastructure.

## Cryptographic handoff

Each recipient key is RSA-3072 (RSA-4096 imports also accepted), exponent 65537. Each envelope has a fresh random AES-256 key and 96-bit nonce. RSA-OAEP with SHA-256/MGF1-SHA256 wraps the AES key. AES-GCM with a 128-bit tag authenticates the complete prefix and payload. The public recipient is DER SPKI in base64; the private key file contains DER PKCS8 in base64.

Envelope bytes are `TGWSEAL1\n`, a big-endian uint32 JSON-header length, the header, ciphertext, and a 16-byte GCM tag. The header has exactly `algorithm`, `key`, and `nonce`; algorithm is `RSA-OAEP-256+A256GCM`. The complete prefix through the header is GCM additional authenticated data. Header size is bounded at 8192 bytes. The CLI streams payloads up to 8 GiB and authenticates before installing the requested output; it refuses overwriting an existing destination. This is a project-specific envelope around standard cryptographic primitives, not an independently audited encryption format.

The original evidence bytes are attested **before** placing the evidence and attestation in the encrypted outer package. This avoids a circular dependency between the archive's hash and a certificate included inside that same archive. For public repositories, attestation metadata (repository, workflow, commit, artifact name and digest) is public. Never put chat names in public metadata.

## Limits and validation

This mode uses the existing signed journal, resumable history reader, and media queue. It collects one visible chat, not Secret Chats, deleted history from before collection, or all account dialogs. Dialog enumeration is capped at 20,000. Existing attachment type/size limits and a 4 GiB export limit apply. Live updates for the selected chat can also be observed during the read; the history is not an atomic Telegram snapshot. Generated screenshots and screen recordings are not part of this mode.

Tests cover synthetic fresh login, scope isolation, media, cancellation, partial deadline completion, failed logout, forbidden API paths and fields, preloaded workspace rejection, wrong-key and tamper rejection, required verifier flags, and browser/Python encryption interoperability. The browser acceptance test uses a plainly labelled mock attestation; it is not a real Sigstore test. Real hosted-runner, Docker, GitHub attestation, and live Telegram acceptance must be reported separately from local synthetic checks.

[GitHub Actions terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features#actions) restrict use of hosted runners to the software project's lifecycle. A fork does not remove these restrictions; this preview must not be marketed as unrestricted free production hosting. [Cloudflare Quick Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/quick-tunnels/) are also intended for testing and development. The helper/workflows are suitable for evaluating this feature; production service eligibility remains a separate deployment requirement.

## Maintainer release sequence

1. Commit and review the collector, supervisor, container definition and tests.
2. Pin that collector commit in `sealed-collector.yml`, then commit/review the reusable workflow. Never silently derive the checkout from the caller SHA.
3. Pin the reusable workflow commit in `sealed-witness.yml` and add its workflow/collector SHA pair to `sealed_policy.json` in a trusted release.
4. Publish all referenced commits and the helper, then test an independent fork and the real GitHub certificate. Do not squash away commits referenced by these pins unless the references are regenerated and published again.

See [reusable workflows and attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/use-artifact-attestations/increase-security-rating) for the distinction between the caller repository and the upstream signer.
