# Sealed capture from a personal fork

**Preview available from `main`.** A fork launches a pinned reusable workflow from
`phishdestroy/TgWitness`. The workflow exports an account, selected chats or one
chat's event journal using a newly created Telegram session, attests the evidence
ZIP or multipart manifest, and uploads only
recipient-encrypted handoffs. The normal administration panel is not exposed.

Choose `client=official_web` to run the [official-client witness](OFFICIAL-WITNESS.md) with guarded Telegram Web controls and video. It requires your own upstream proxy and observes one rendered chat. The default `client=api` retains the full-account export modes described below.

The verifier checks the archive against its GitHub attestation, the approved
workflow and collector commits, and the signed journal and attachment hashes.
The collection process uses pinned upstream code and fresh storage. A reviewer
can inspect that code and verify the delivered archive against its recorded run.

## User flow

The helper explains the five stages and lets you try message or collector
substitution on sample data. **Start my capture** opens the wizard.

1. Choose **GitHub Actions capture (preview)** on the project homepage, the
   workspace login screen, or **Exports → Open capture helper**. You can also
   open the [official helper](https://phishdestroy.github.io/TgWitness/sealed.html?lang=en)
   or `tgwitness/static/capture.html` from a trusted checkout in a modern browser.
   The helper makes no network requests for key or
   file processing. The helper supports the site's interface languages; the
   temporary collection panel supports English and Russian.
2. Generate a key and save **sealed-key.json**. This is the only private
   decryption key. Copy the separate public **recipient** value. Losing the
   private key loses access to both the connection and the archive.
   Confirm that you saved it to unlock the next step. If you already have a
   delivery file, load the saved key and choose **I already have an archive**.
3. Fork TgWitness, enable Actions in the fork, and run **Sealed chat capture**.
   Paste the public recipient and choose 30, 60, or 120 minutes. Never put a
   phone number, login code, Telegram password, private key, or session in
   workflow inputs, commits, issues, or logs.
4. During the run, download **sealed-connection** from Artifacts and unzip it.
   Load `connection.tgwsealed` in the helper, using the saved private key.
   The resulting link contains a random access secret in its URL fragment.
   Keep this link private. The panel removes the fragment and keeps the secret
   in this tab's session storage; it is not placed in HTTP access logs.
5. Open the connection link. Sign in with a QR code, or with your phone number and the
   login code. Enter your two-step verification password if Telegram asks for it. The
   built-in API credential pool is used by default, just like the normal workspace. You
   may expand the optional custom credentials section and enter both `api_id` and
   `api_hash` from [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps). Leave both
   fields empty to use the built-in pool; a partial or malformed pair is rejected.
   Session imports are not allowed. Choose the export mode and scope. The connection
   link contains an access secret: keep it private.
6. Choose **Telegram Takeout**, **Regular Telegram API** or **Chat event journal**.
   For account export, choose all accessible chats or load and select one or more
   chats, then set dates, chat types, account categories and attachment rules.
   Check settings and size, optionally save the settings JSON for an independent
   reviewer, then press **Start capture**. Settings are fixed after starting.
   Resume works only while this runner exists; finishing early preserves acquired
   data and records gaps. Deadline expiry after starting produces an explicitly
   partial archive; expiry before starting or cancellation produces no archive.
7. Wait for **sealed-result**, download and unzip it, and decrypt
   `delivery.tgwsealed` in the helper. You receive `delivery.zip`, containing
   `evidence.zip`, `attestation.jsonl`, and instructions. Browser decryption is
   limited to 256 MiB; larger packages use the streaming local command below.
   Large results also include `delivery-NNNNNN.tgwsealed` parts; the main
   `delivery.tgwsealed` then contains `evidence.parts.json` and the attestation.
   Download every part and assemble locally as described below.
8. End the temporary session in Telegram Settings → Devices if revocation was
   not confirmed or the runner was killed. Normal completion requests logout, and
   the run records whether revocation was confirmed.

The repository must contain the published pinned source and reusable-workflow
commits. A local branch alone cannot be invoked by another GitHub repository.

## Session time budget

Before collection, **Calculate time and size** estimates the selected history and files
from message counts and a bounded sample. The display includes time already spent signing
in, estimated collection time and a reserve for packaging. For files, the initial estimate
uses 1 MiB/s and a twofold time margin; progress replaces that assumption with the measured
rate. Use **Messages only** or select fewer chats when the estimate exceeds the remaining time.

Telegram's reported Takeout wait is added to the budget. The collector stops acquisition
when the remaining time is needed for packaging, retains acquired data and marks a partial
result. A 120-minute session therefore uses its remaining collection window rather than
waiting for the deadline before preparing the archive. The display identifies selections
whose full size could not be sampled.

## Choose this mode or a persistent workspace

| Capture mode | Configurable scope | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Telegram Takeout, the default | All accessible cloud chats or selected chats, dates, account categories, media policies and JSON/HTML views | Uses Telegram's official export mechanism; approval or waiting may be required. Takeout can enumerate left channels/groups where Telegram permits it and request additional personal data. |
| Regular Telegram API | The same account scope and output choices, subject to methods available through the regular API | Does not initialize Takeout; cannot enumerate left channels/supergroups or fetch Takeout-only personal data. Contacts cover Telegram users rather than the complete saved phone contact list. Rate limits still apply. |
| Chat event journal | One selected chat, attachment policies and optional avatars | Captures history and changes observed during this run. Account categories, date filters and Desktop-compatible views do not apply. |

All three modes have the same GitHub attestation and encrypted delivery. Takeout
selects the acquisition method and is never silently replaced by regular API access.
TgWitness generates the JSON/HTML views from the captured records and preserves
the selected acquisition method in the export. See the
[official Takeout API](https://core.telegram.org/api/takeout).

Defaults use Takeout, all accessible chat types including archived chats, all
dates, account profile and contacts, compatible JSON and HTML, and file downloads.
The initial media budget is 4 GiB, with visible per-type file limits; larger files
or exhausted download budgets use server hashes where available. Review these
limits before collecting. Hashes cannot reconstruct a file. Optional photos,
stories, session metadata and extra personal data remain separate choices.

Takeout may require approval in an established Telegram session. Telegram sets
the delay; a new login or runner does not bypass it. The maximum capture window
is 120 minutes including login and approval, so a large account or long approval
wait may not finish. A persistent local export can resume the same session, but
does not inherit GitHub attestation.

### Agree and verify the settings

After **Check settings and size**, use **Save settings for verification**. Agree
the resulting `sealed-export-settings.json` with the reviewer before collection.
Changes invalidate the saved assessment. The collector signs the effective
settings and their SHA-256, and account-export receipts bind the same options.
The verifier reports the actual mode, selection and completeness, and rejects a
disagreement between the journal and nested account export.

```sh
python -m tgwitness.sealed_verify evidence.zip --bundle attestation.jsonl --repo OWNER/TgWitness --expected-selection sealed-export-settings.json --require-complete
```

`--expected-selection` rejects a different transport, chat scope, filter or
attachment policy. `--require-complete` accepts only account exports and chat
journals recorded as complete. Without these flags, verification still checks provenance and
integrity while reporting the recorded settings and gaps. Agree the expected
selection before the run and keep it separately from the archive. The scope and acquisition intervals identify the material captured during
the run; use retained earlier observations when comparing previous versions.

| Need | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| Export accessible account data or selected chats during a limited session and give a reviewer an externally attested archive | GitHub Actions capture (preview) |
| Observe several chats continuously, manage accounts, search and read a growing archive | Local or Docker workspace |

This starts a separate capture with a new login. It does not upload your existing
local journal, export the currently open workspace, or reuse its Telegram session.
An unfinished cloud capture cannot resume after its runner is destroyed; a new
workflow starts a new capture.

The workspace's **Exports → Open capture helper** opens the complete wizard
inside the panel. The standalone page uses the same wizard, controls and themes.
Both keep keys and decryption in your browser. GitHub workflow startup and the
temporary Telegram panel open in separate tabs; the wizard tells you when to
return. Locking the workspace clears the wizard's in-memory key. Your saved key
file remains on your device.

## What is public, and what must stay private

Collection runs on a standard GitHub-hosted runner. GitHub, the approved collector
and dependencies, the helper page, the browser and the HTTPS tunnel are trusted
parts of this setup. The temporary host processes the Telegram session and
plaintext messages; the delivered artifacts are encrypted for the recipient.

Forking copies project code into your repository. It does **not** export your
Telegram account. The recipient workflow input is a public encryption key.
Keep `sealed-key.json`, Telegram credentials, login codes, 2FA passwords and the
decrypted connection URL out of commits, workflow inputs and public logs.

The workflow publishes encrypted connection/result artifacts for one day.
Download both in time; GitHub Actions availability, account limits and billing
apply. A public fork is not a promise of unlimited free compute. No payment or
GitHub access token is entered into the helper.

The private decryption key stays in your browser/file. Telegram session material
and plaintext observations necessarily exist inside the temporary collector.
GitHub and the HTTPS tunnel remain trusted infrastructure. Attestation may make
the archive digest and workflow identity public; the archive contents are not
placed in the attestation. The attestation timestamp is not a message timestamp.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Next step |
| --- | --- |
| No **Run workflow** button | Open your own fork, enable Actions, and sync it with upstream `main`. Do not edit the approved upstream pins to bypass a failure. |
| No `sealed-connection` artifact | Check whether the job started and completed its startup/upload step. Queue, runner, image download, tunnel or repository policy failures can prevent startup. |
| Cannot open the connection | Load the saved key for this run, unzip the downloaded artifact and select `connection.tgwsealed`. The runner must still be active. |
| History is paused | Check the panel's status and use Resume while the session remains active, or finish with the data already collected. Telegram limits and inaccessible content can leave gaps. |
| No `sealed-result` | Cancellation or expiry before starting collection produces no archive. A failed collection, attestation or packaging step also prevents delivery. Inspect the failed step without posting credentials. |
| Browser cannot decrypt a large archive | Use the streaming CLI below for packages larger than 256 MiB. A wrong or lost private key cannot decrypt the result. |
| Verification rejects the signer | Use a trusted current TgWitness installation and the exact caller `OWNER/REPOSITORY`. Do not accept a replacement policy supplied with the archive. |
| Telegram still lists the temporary session | End it in Settings → Devices. Logout can fail and a forcibly terminated workflow may not run cleanup. |

Before relying on this preview, try a small chat you control: create a message
and attachment, collect them, decrypt the result, run the verifier, check the
coverage/media outcomes and confirm Telegram session revocation. Automated
checks use a synthetic Telegram client plus a separate real GitHub certificate
test; no live-account run on the current revision has been recorded.

## Local decryption and verification

Use tools from an independently trusted installation, not executable files
supplied by an unknown evidence archive:

```sh
python -m tgwitness.sealed_crypto decrypt delivery.tgwsealed --key sealed-key.json --out delivery.zip
# Unzip delivery.zip using your archive manager, then:
python -m tgwitness.sealed_verify evidence.zip --bundle attestation.jsonl --repo OWNER/TgWitness
```

For multipart delivery, decrypt the main package first and keep its extracted
manifest beside every encrypted part, then run:

```sh
python -m tgwitness.sealed_parts evidence.parts.json --key sealed-key.json --out evidence.zip
python -m tgwitness.sealed_verify evidence.parts.json --assembled evidence.zip --bundle attestation.jsonl --repo OWNER/TgWitness
```

The manifest is the attested subject and binds every part and the assembled ZIP.
Use `--max-gib` to set an appropriate uncompressed verification ceiling for a
large archive; the default is 4 GiB. Expected-selection and complete-scope checks
also work with multipart delivery.

Python 3.11+, the project's dependencies, and a recent GitHub CLI supporting
`--signer-digest` and `--deny-self-hosted-runners` are required. A CLI key generator
is also available: `python -m tgwitness.sealed_crypto keygen sealed-key.json`.

The verifier uses `tgwitness/sealed_policy.json` from the trusted installation.
It checks the caller repository, upstream signer workflow, approved signer
commit, hosted runner requirement, complete ZIP digest, internal journal and
attachment integrity, fresh account-key origin, and expected collector commit.
It displays history and media outcomes instead of implying all data was saved.
An empty approved-release list fails closed. Updating the policy is an explicit
trust decision; never accept an archive's own proposed policy automatically.

For offline use, obtain trusted roots ahead of time from a trusted environment:

```sh
gh attestation trusted-root > trusted_root.jsonl
python -m tgwitness.sealed_verify evidence.zip --bundle attestation.jsonl --repo OWNER/TgWitness --trusted-root trusted_root.jsonl
```

The timestamp of the attestation concerns the archive's commitment. It does not
authenticate message timestamps or the collector's wall clock. See
[GitHub's verification options](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation_verify).

## How the fork is kept outside the capture process

The caller contains a job-level reference to the upstream reusable workflow at
a full commit SHA. That workflow explicitly checks out **the upstream repository
at a fixed collector SHA**. A default `actions/checkout` in a reusable workflow
would check out the caller and is intentionally not used.

The workflow does not restore caller caches, consume caller artifacts, execute
caller files, or accept source/image URLs, shell commands, prepared ZIP files,
or hashes to sign. It accepts a bounded public recipient and session duration.
Actions, the Python base image, and cloudflared are pinned by immutable digests;
Python dependencies use the existing hash-locked requirements. The image is
built from the trusted source without a cache.

The collector runs as a non-root user with a read-only image, dropped Linux
capabilities, resource limits, and no Docker socket or GitHub-token environment.
Its only mounts are fresh configuration, workspace, and output directories.
The restricted FastAPI application exposes login, dialogs, configurable account or chat collection,
status, resume, finish, and cancellation. There is no plaintext download route,
general administration route, import route, or signing endpoint.

The supervisor stops the network-facing containers before the attest action
reads the final fixed `evidence.zip` or `evidence.parts.json`. The packaging container has no network.
The upload steps name only `connection.tgwsealed` and `delivery*.tgwsealed`;
neither plaintext evidence nor Telegram credentials are uploaded as artifacts.
Cleanup removes the private directories and containers, and GitHub discards the
hosted runner VM after the job. Artifact retention is one day; download before expiry.

A fork owner can replace the caller or create a different signed file. The
strict verifier must reject the resulting **different signer workflow/digest**.
This construction still depends on the absence of exploitable bugs in approved
code and on the integrity of GitHub's runner and signing infrastructure.

## Cryptographic handoff

Each recipient key is RSA-3072 (RSA-4096 imports also accepted), exponent 65537.
Each envelope has a fresh random AES-256 key and 96-bit nonce. RSA-OAEP with
SHA-256/MGF1-SHA256 wraps the AES key. AES-GCM with a 128-bit tag authenticates
the complete prefix and payload. The public recipient is DER SPKI in base64;
the private key file contains DER PKCS8 in base64.

Envelope bytes are `TGWSEAL1\n`, a big-endian uint32 JSON-header length, the
header, ciphertext, and a 16-byte GCM tag. The header has exactly `algorithm`,
`key`, and `nonce`; algorithm is `RSA-OAEP-256+A256GCM`. The complete prefix
through the header is GCM additional authenticated data. Header size is bounded
at 8192 bytes. The CLI streams payloads up to 8 GiB and authenticates before
installing the requested output; it refuses overwriting an existing destination.
This is a project-specific envelope around standard cryptographic primitives:
RSA-OAEP with SHA-256 and AES-256-GCM, available in OpenSSL and every major
cryptography library.

The original evidence bytes are attested **before** placing the evidence and
attestation in the encrypted outer package. This avoids a circular dependency
between the archive's hash and a certificate included inside that same archive.
For public repositories, attestation metadata (repository, workflow, commit,
artifact name and digest) is public. Never put chat names in public metadata.

## Scope and validation

This mode uses the signed journal and account-export engine. Secret Chats,
deleted history from before collection and data inaccessible to the account are
excluded. Private cloud chats are eligible when selected. The chat picker is
capped at 20,000 dialogs; account export discovers its own inventory. Missing data, failed files and unfinished
tasks are recorded. Attachment limits and runner disk/time limits still apply.
Large delivery uses encrypted parts instead of a fixed 4 GiB delivery cutoff.
Completion means the frozen selected tasks finished, not that every historical
Telegram record exists in the archive. The chat journal can also observe live
updates; neither mode is an atomic snapshot. Generated screenshots and screen
recordings are not part of this mode.

Tests cover synthetic fresh login, scope isolation, media, cancellation,
partial deadline completion, failed logout, forbidden API paths and fields,
preloaded workspace rejection, wrong-key and tamper rejection, required verifier
flags, and browser/Python encryption interoperability. The browser acceptance
test uses a plainly labelled mock attestation; it is not a real Sigstore test.
Real hosted-runner, Docker, GitHub attestation, and live Telegram acceptance
must be reported separately from local synthetic checks.

[GitHub Actions terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features#actions)
restrict use of hosted runners to the software project's lifecycle. A fork does
not remove these restrictions; this preview must not be marketed as unrestricted
free production hosting. [Cloudflare Quick Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/quick-tunnels/)
are also intended for testing and development. The helper/workflows are suitable
for evaluating this feature; production service eligibility remains a separate
deployment requirement.

## Maintainer release sequence

1. Commit and review the collector, supervisor, container definition and tests.
2. Pin that collector commit in `sealed-collector.yml`, then commit/review the
   reusable workflow. Never silently derive the checkout from the caller SHA.
3. Pin the reusable workflow commit in `sealed-witness.yml` and add its
   workflow/collector SHA pair to `sealed_policy.json` in a trusted release.
4. Publish all referenced commits and the helper, then test an independent fork
   and the real GitHub certificate. Do not squash away commits referenced by
   these pins unless the references are regenerated and published again.

See [reusable workflows and attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/use-artifact-attestations/increase-security-rating)
for the distinction between the caller repository and the upstream signer.
