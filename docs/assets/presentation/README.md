# Investigation presentation kit

The shared visual system for the repository and wiki: a dark casework panel,
large outlined type, blue signals, warm accents and linked observations. The
application mark stays visible alongside the investigation sequence. The earlier dossier artwork
was generated with Gemini and is retained with its SVG typography and animation.

The service and handbook sections use TgWitness's navy surfaces, ice-blue signals
and warm gold accents, matching the casework covers and diagrams. Compact cards,
split buttons and animated dividers keep the page easy to scan. Detailed
instructions and the complete page index expand below them.

## Use and maintenance

The README opens with the casework banner. The title and record labels remain
readable while an observation moves along the chain. The handbook uses the same
typography and record cards, with a separate phone composition. Parent `picture`
sources select still files for reduced motion. Illustrative records are labelled;
the workspace loop below them is captured from the actual fictional demo.

Setup actions use the icon, title, subtitle and accent-line structure shared with
ShortDot, TrustName and the forensic toolkit. Motion runs inside each linked SVG;
the labels remain still and a `picture` source selects a still when motion is reduced.

Three navigation images lead to the real demo, local setup and handbook. The real
application recording follows, with a clear caption distinguishing it from the
illustration. Feature copy stays concise; installation commands, the main evidence
diagram and trust boundaries remain visible. Details expand where they are needed.
Motion is part of the page design, with no players or download prompts.

Regenerate the casework covers, buttons and responsive diagrams:

```sh
python website/render_casework.py --display-font /path/to/SpaceGrotesk.ttf --text-font /path/to/Manrope.ttf
```

Regenerate the feature workflows, service cards, handbook routes and compact navigation buttons:

```sh
python website/render_readme_panels.py --font /path/to/Manrope.ttf
```

Captions are outlined to prevent installed fonts from changing the card layout.

Regenerate the fifteen practical handbook chapter covers:

```sh
python website/render_wiki_headers.py --font /path/to/Manrope.ttf
```
The workflow drawings explain existing functions; they are not screenshots or
live status indicators. Investigation uses recorded content and source references;
the illustrated connections do not imply an automatic graph interface. Chat
export acquires the history visible at export time, while saved versions depend
on what collection actually observed. The author statement and detailed evidence
limits remain in the README and handbook.

The renderer preserves the application's original mark. It reads no account data
and makes no network requests. Metadata badges use the version in `pyproject.toml`;
regenerate them with `render_identity.py` after a version change.

Regenerate the earlier technical banners with Space Grotesk, distributed under the
[SIL Open Font License](OFL-SpaceGrotesk.txt):

```sh
python website/render_repository_banner.py --font /path/to/SpaceGrotesk.ttf
```

Regenerate buttons, badges, dividers and the retained dossier covers with Manrope:

```sh
python website/render_identity.py --font /path/to/Manrope.ttf
```

Regenerate the supporting phone evidence diagram and earlier case-path assets with:

```sh
python website/render_case_assets.py --font /path/to/Manrope.ttf
```

Both renderers require `fonttools`. Captions are outlined using the retained OFL-licensed
Manrope font. The images have no remote fonts or scripts. The previous compact
journal cover remains reproducible with `website/render_readme.py` for older links.

Each animated `picture` selects a separate still for reduced motion. The mobile
cover has a separate composition. The `readme-*` animation
exports leave reduced-motion selection to the containing `picture`: another media
query inside the selected SVG can read the operating-system preference instead
and unexpectedly freeze the animation. Standalone documentation SVGs retain their
own reduced-motion behavior.
The [illustrated reference](../../SHOWCASE.md) shows the diagrams inline. Additional screenshots,
tamper/checkpoint explanations, the notice and the source map expand on demand.

Use relative links inside the repository. The wiki builder copies referenced images
into the separate Wiki repository and rewrites their links. Keep captions in image
alt text too; never replace essential instructions with an image.

The SVGs are self-contained and contain no JavaScript. Headings and captions are
outlined from Manrope for consistent rendering. The font licence is retained in
[OFL-Manrope.txt](OFL-Manrope.txt). Review animation as an ordinary image, both
themes and a narrow viewport before replacing an asset.


To refresh the workspace loop, build the site with `python tools/build_site.py`,
then run `python website/capture_readme.py` with Playwright Chromium and Pillow
installed. The capture script opens only the local demo, performs the real UI
actions and exports light/dark desktop and phone variants. Each state holds for
3.5–5 seconds, with short dissolves between screenshots. It does not connect an
account or synthesize application content. Reduced-motion sources show the saved
versions as a still.

## Films and animations

The archived concept films are silent H.264 MP4s using
fictional records. The investigation overview renders the illustrated SVG sequence
at 24 frames per second. The two earlier concept films retain their original exports
and GIF alternatives. These films illustrate the workflow; they are not recordings
of a live account.

These files are retained as source assets for maintainers. The README and Wiki
use inline animated illustrations, with no film navigation, player blocks or
download prompts. The publication builder allows only these three MP4s and the
two named GIFs. SVG animations keep their static reduced-motion alternatives;
the message-history still is [`message-history-static.png`](message-history-static.png).

## Preview images

Both PNGs are rendered from the static repository identity, with the same
illustration and outlined typography as the repository. From the development
environment with Playwright Chromium installed:

```sh
python website/render_presentation.py
```

Use `--format github` or `--format social` to render one image. The renderer blocks
network requests and does not open the application or account data.

The website builder includes `preview-social.png` automatically. GitHub's repository
sharing image is a separate setting: upload `preview-github.png` under
**Settings → Social preview → Edit → Upload an image**. It follows
[GitHub's recommended dimensions and file limit](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview).
