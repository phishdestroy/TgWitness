"""High-assurance deployment of a collector on a cloud server behind a Cloudflare Tunnel.

    python -m tgwitness.cloud plan   --provider P ...  the cloud-init and API calls; nothing is created
    python -m tgwitness.cloud deploy --provider P ...  tunnel, DNS, firewall and server; waits for the key
    python -m tgwitness.cloud lock   --record ...      removes every inbound firewall rule (debug deployments)
    python -m tgwitness.cloud verify --record ...      a report from the provider, Cloudflare and the collector
    python -m tgwitness.cloud destroy --record ...     deletes the server, firewall, DNS records and tunnel

Providers (tgwitness/providers): hetzner, digitalocean, linode, vultr, aws. The server is created
through the provider's API without an SSH key, behind a provider firewall with no inbound rules,
and SSH is masked from the first boot. TgWitness is installed from one commit and creates its
signing key on that server; the panel is reached only through the tunnel. A verifier with
read-only credentials compares the provider's own log and firewall, the tunnel connector's
address and the collector's signed statement. "generic" installs on any server by hand with
install.sh and is never more than self-attested. Nothing here shows what a provider can do on
its own hypervisor.

--quick-tunnel needs no domain and no Cloudflare account: cloudflared opens a random
https://*.trycloudflare.com address that changes whenever it restarts. The server posts each
address, signed with a key only the deployment directory holds, to a ntfy.sh topic, where deploy
and the panel look it up. No Cloudflare account keeps records of such a tunnel, so verify cannot
check its connector.
