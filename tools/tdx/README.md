# Intel TDX test vectors

Real quotes and Intel collateral for `tools/check_tdx.py`, the quotes as hex text. They are checked
against the pinned Intel SGX Root CA by `tgwitness.tdx`, at a time inside each collateral's
validity window.

`../tsa/time-stamps.json` holds real RFC 3161 replies of the Belgian government's qualified
time-stamping authority and of FreeTSA over a fixed report, for `tools/check_attestation_report.py`.

The collateral files use dcap-qvl's JSON layout, which `python -m tgwitness.cloud verify --tdx-collateral` accepts.
