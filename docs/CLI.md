# Command line for scripts and agents

[Read-only MCP](MCP.md) · [Full-text search](SEARCH.md) · [Wiki](wiki/Archive-and-Integrations.md)

**Preview.** `tgwitness search`, `context`, `messages`, `stats` and `export` read
saved observations for scripts and AI agents. They cannot send anything to
Telegram, change settings or modify the signed journal.

With `--json`, stdout carries exactly one JSON document (`export` writes JSON Lines).
Progress, hints and errors go to stderr. Exit codes are stable:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success, including an empty result |
| `1` | Failure: unreachable panel, unreadable data, interrupted export |
| `2` | Usage error or invalid request: bad date, unknown option, search index off |
| `3` | Unavailable now: the workspace is open in a running panel, or the panel asks to retry later (rate limit, timeout) |
| `4` | Access refused: missing, expired or revoked token, a chat outside its scope, a tool it does not allow |

## Two ways to read

**Through the panel (`--url`).** The command uses the same scoped archive API as
MCP. Create a connection in **Integrations → MCP**: choose workspaces and chats,
tools and an expiry, then copy the token once. The connection is read-only, limited
to those chats, rate-limited to 60 requests per minute and can be revoked or
rotated at any time. Panel login tokens and Telegram credentials do not work here.

```sh
export TGWITNESS_URL=https://panel.example.org      # default http://127.0.0.1:8787
export TGWITNESS_MCP_TOKEN=tgw_mcp_...              # or --token-file path
tgwitness search 'перевод карта' --json
```

A remote panel needs HTTPS; plain HTTP is accepted only for `127.0.0.1`,
`localhost` and `::1`. Proxy environment variables are ignored and redirects are
refused, so the token reaches only the address you give.

**Directly from a stopped workspace (`--data-dir`).** Reads the data directory with
full local access, without a token. Use it on a copy of a data directory or while
collection is stopped. Signed records are never changed; like the panel, opening a
workspace may bring its derived indexes up to date. When the panel has the workspace open, the command exits with
code `3`; read through the panel instead. Without `--data-dir`, `TGWITNESS_DATA`,
`./data/live` or the data directory of the installation running the command is used.

`--workspace ID` selects a workspace (default `default`). `tgwitness messages
--workspaces` lists the ones you can read.

## Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `tgwitness search QUERY [--chat ID] [--since] [--until] [--any] [--limit N] [--offset N]` | Best matches first, with word forms, exact phrases in quotes, domains and `@username` ([syntax](SEARCH.md#search-syntax)) |
| `tgwitness search QUERY --exact [--before SEQ]` | Exact text, newest first, without the index |
| `tgwitness context CHAT_ID MESSAGE_ID` | Saved messages within ten message IDs on either side |
| `tgwitness messages` | Chats you can read |
| `tgwitness messages CHAT_ID [--since] [--until] [--before SEQ]` | Saved messages of the chat, newest first |
| `tgwitness messages CHAT_ID --message ID` | Every saved version and deletion record of one message |
| `tgwitness stats [--chat ID] [--sender ID] [--since] [--until] [--top N]` | Activity statistics, below |
| `tgwitness export [--chat ID] [--since] [--until] [--output FILE]` | Saved observations as JSON Lines in journal order |

Dates are `2026-10-01` (UTC midnight) or ISO times with a timezone,
`2026-10-01T09:00+03:00`. For `search`, `messages` and `export` they select
observation time. Pages hold up to 50 records: follow `next_offset` (`--offset`) for
ranked search and `next_before` (`--before`) elsewhere.

Every message result carries `untrusted_content: true`, the workspace, chat and
message IDs, the journal sequence, the saved record hash and a panel link. Edits,
deletion notices and `missing_on_recheck` are separate records. Absence of a record
does not prove that an event never happened.

### Activity statistics

`stats` counts saved observations for one chat, one sender, or every chat in scope:

- messages by UTC hour and by weekday (Monday first), busiest hours and days;
- edited, deleted and `missing_on_recheck` shares;
- senders with message counts and first and last message times;
- the most frequent domains and `@handles`, counted once per message across its
  saved versions;
- coverage: `coverage.gap` records and, for access to the whole workspace, periods
  without a connected collector heartbeat (`collector_liveness`).

The period selects **message time reported by Telegram**. Hour and weekday counts can
help estimate a sender's time zone; they do not establish it. Figures are computed on
request from the journal and are not stored. Each result names the journal head it
covers when your access spans the workspace. Reading stops after five seconds through
the panel, or `--timeout` seconds locally (default 30); then `complete` is false and
`partial` names the first record that was not read. Only the most recent records are
counted in that case.

### Export

`export` writes one JSON object per saved observation (new messages, snapshots,
edits, recovered messages, deletion notices, `missing_on_recheck` and saved media
records) in journal order. Each line has the same fields as other results, with
the full text. With `--output`, the file is written under a `.partial` name and
renamed only after the panel's completion record; an interrupted export leaves no
file and exits with code `1`. `--output` never overwrites an existing file. With
`--output` and `--json`, stdout carries a summary: record count, last journal
sequence and, for whole-workspace access, the journal head.

An export through the panel needs a connection that allows **Export messages
(command line only)**; it is not selected by default. This file is a working copy, not evidence: for a verifiable
handover use the signed export in **Exports**, which `python -m tgwitness.verify`
checks.

The panel rechecks access before emitting each record, including the completion
record. Revoked or expired access leaves an incomplete export. Lazy page reads
share the archive worker limit with other queries and have a bounded wait.

## Agent skill

[`.agents/skills/tgwitness-cli/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/tgwitness-cli/SKILL.md)
tells an agent how to use these commands, how to cite records and how to treat
captured text. Agents that read `.agents/skills` load it from a repository
checkout. For Claude Code, copy the `tgwitness-cli` folder to `.claude/skills/` in
your project or `~/.claude/skills/`.

## MCP and the command line

Both use the same connections, scope checks and limits. MCP results are limited to
one 64 KiB page, so MCP offers no bulk export; the command line streams it.
`get_activity_stats` is available to both.
