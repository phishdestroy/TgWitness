## Build and inspect

From the project root:

```sh
python tools/build_site.py
python tools/check_site.py
```

Follow the [local preview instructions](../docs/internal/PUBLISHING.md#preview-the-website-locally)
for serving the generated pages. Edit these sources, not generated files in `dist/`.
Preserve keyboard navigation, both themes and the no-JavaScript fallback.

The homepage notice links to the complete, attributed [operator statement](../docs/OPERATOR-INCOMPATIBILITY.md).
Its original text and the licence are included as local site downloads. Run
`python tools/sync_notice.py --check` before building. Publish the checked output
using the [Pages procedure](../docs/internal/PUBLISHING.md#publish-the-generated-static-branch).

The examples use fictional data. Changes to explanatory diagrams should stay aligned
with the [evidence model](../docs/EVIDENCE.md).
